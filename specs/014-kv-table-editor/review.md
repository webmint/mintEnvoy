- Confirmed: 0 | Contested: 0 | Dismissed: 1 | Uncertain: 0
- Finders skipped (not installed): none

## Dismissed / Worth a Glance
These findings were reviewed but not confirmed. Dismissed findings had no demonstrable emergent defect at feature scope; uncertain findings could not be resolved from the code alone. A reviewer may want to glance at them before closing the review.

### Dismissed
- [D-001] [Medium] src/renderer/src/components/organisms/__tests__/KVTable.stories.tsx:48 — Value-cell padded-token seg.raw verbatim contract not locked at the component-integration level

## Methodology
Findings are grounded — every finding carries a verbatim quote from the actual
cross-task code, and validation discards ungrounded ones. A refutation stage
then cross-examines each grounded finding before it reaches the report: a
finding earns the headline only by surviving an adversary who default-dismisses
anything not demonstrable as emergent at feature scope. Confirmed findings reach
the headline; dismissed findings and low-stakes uncertain findings drop to the
Dismissed / Worth a Glance appendix; contested findings (a high-stakes `security`
/ `[CONSTITUTION-VIOLATION]` finding the refuter could not confirm, or a
`[CONSTITUTION-VIOLATION]` finding the refuter dismissed) are surfaced in the
headline, flagged `[CONTESTED]`, never buried. This report is findings only —
the verdict is `/verify`'s.
