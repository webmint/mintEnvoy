# Architecture — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

> Commands named in backticks (e.g. `constitute`, `onboard`) are invoked with the `/` prefix in Claude Code (e.g. `/constitute`).
>
> **Project**: {{PROJECT_NAME}} — see the project primer (`CLAUDE.md`) for stack facts (language, framework, build/lint/typecheck commands) and, for multi-package projects, the `## Packages` table with per-package detail. This file captures architectural **decisions, rules, and flow** — the "why" behind the setup, not the "what".

---

## Architectural Decisions

_Populated by `constitute` — records WHY decisions were made, not just what. Format: **Decision** — rationale + tradeoffs considered._

## Layer Boundaries & Dependency Rules

_Populated by `constitute` (for new/greenfield projects — chosen patterns) or `onboard` (for brownfield projects — extracted from existing code). Documents which layers exist, what imports from what, and which directions are forbidden._

## Data Flow

_Populated by `onboard` (for brownfield — scan findings) or by tech-writer as features are built. Captures how data moves through the system end-to-end._

## Cross-cutting Concerns

_Populated as relevant: authentication/authorization approach, error propagation strategy, logging/observability, transaction boundaries, caching strategy, feature flagging. Filled in by `constitute` or discovered by `onboard`._
